# Longboard
Code for electronic longboard

This repo contains the code for my electric longboard. The longboard is motorized and has LED strips running around the bottom. An arduino pro micro controls the LEDs, motor, and a bluetooth module. The bluetooth module is used to communicate with an accompanying android app.

There are two parts to this project's code - the arduino sketch, and the android app.

The "Longboard" folder contains the android app.

The "arduino_files" folder contains different sketches used for testing purposes, and "longboard_sketch," which contains the code that actually runs on the longboard.
